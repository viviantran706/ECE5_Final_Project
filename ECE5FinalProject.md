The first photo is a clearer and full body image of the protype where you can see all of the breadboards that were temporially taped on to the body. The second photo shows sa better view of the photoresitors where we were testing the height. However, in the photo is looks slanted but it is stright and evenly touching the ground.

# Reflections 
We wished we were able to understand why our robot would slow down then speed up would really had helped us. And knowing that we didnt have to proboard becuase we were never taught that or hwo to bridge and never instruced when it was given to us. SO this did slow us down alot have haev many error. Which we ended up scratching that and movig it back to a regualr board.
